In the COVID-19 prediction and evaluation competition at the 6th China Health Information Processing Conference, given the time series data and regional characteristic data of confirmed cases in three regions, we need to predict the confirmed cases for the next 7 days. 

Our work:

1. Data cleaning for outliers; design a hierarchical classification feature coding scheme to encode the text information.
2. Conduct sufficient experiments to comprehensively compare the performance of multiple models.
3. Improve the model based on Huber Regression, which significantly reduces the sensitivity of model fitting to data outliers.
