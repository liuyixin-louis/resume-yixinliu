abstract: "As infamous invader to the North American ecosystem, the Asian giant
  hornet (Vespa mandarinia) is devastating not only to native bee colonies, but
  also to local agriculture. One of the most effective ways to combat this
  harmful species is to locate and destroy their nests. By mobilizing the public
  to actively report possible sightings of the Asian giant hornet, the
  government could timely send inspectors to confirm and possibly destroy the
  nests. However, such confirmation requires lab expertise, where manually
  checking the reports one by one is extremely consuming of human resources.
  Further, given the limited knowledge of the public about the Asian giant
  hornet and the randomness of report submission, only a few of the numerous
  reports proved positive, i.e. existing nests. How to classify or prioritize
  the reports efficiently and automatically, so as to determine the dispatch of
  personnel, is of great significance to the control of the Asian giant hornet.
  In this paper, we propose a method to predict the priority of sighting reports
  based on machine learning. We model the problem of optimal prioritization of
  sighting reports as a problem of classification and prediction. We extracted a
  variety of rich features in the report: location, time, image(s), and textual
  description. Based on these characteristics, we propose a classification model
  based on logistic regression to predict the credibility of a certain report.
  Furthermore, our model quantifies the impact between reports to get the
  priority ranking of the reports. Extensive experiments on the WSDA public
  dataset have proved the effectiveness of our method."
